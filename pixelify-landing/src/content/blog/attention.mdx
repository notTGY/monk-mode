Attention is the most valuable asset in our day and age. Just look at the largest corporations - they all try monetizing our attention by running ads or playing psychological trics on our brains.

The easiest solution for saving your productivity is to completely quit social networks, email services and web search. And it is great, if this solution works for you, but more and more professions nowadays require constantly accessing information online. At least to keep up with trends and stay relevant.

And if you give up all those incredible platforms, then instead of gaining productivity you will start losing your edge.

Here, at <strong class="text-purple-foreground">Pixelify</strong>, we believe regaining focus should not come at a cost of competitive disadvantage. That is why we built our application to only block distractive images on websites you select.

We aim at **the root of distractions**, leaving relevant text content untouched. This approach ensures you get most out of internet without losing focus or sacrifising productivity.

It has been proven, that even a single distraction causes 20 minutes of deep focus to vanish. So even if Pixelify can block just one screaming-colored image a day, over time it adds up. And you will regain hours of quality time every month.

Strop frying your brain and take control of your time today! It's free, and you can always change your mind later.
