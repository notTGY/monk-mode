### customization feature
TODO: hardcode implementation
TODO: change filters

### points feature
### schedule feature

### cheat feature
TODO: Add shortcut, so that it is easy to cheat. For example, hover with Shift+Ctrl key on.

## low priority

TODO: support gif and videos (animated avatars and stickers in telegram)
TODO: support background-url property. Maybe block it only if there are no children? (it would be easier to crawl & makes sense, cuz otherwise you may block useful background)
