## Backlog

### customization feature

TODO: hardcode implementation

TODO: change filters

### points feature
### schedule feature

## low priority

TODO: support gif and videos (animated avatars and stickers in telegram)

TODO: support background-url property. Maybe block it only if there are no children? (it would be easier to crawl & makes sense, cuz otherwise you may block useful background)

TODO: actually unmount when toggling tab pixelation

TODO: send toggle event with url, so that only respective tab will switch. Think about how to get current window status (eg. I have tab 1 and tab 2. I went to tab 2, switched on, now pixelation is on in localstorage. I go back to tab 1, even though pixelation is off, in UI it says pixelation is on)
